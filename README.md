# Operation: Bankroll

Concept module to allow open source project maintainers to use Drupal Commerce and its recurring framework to receive
funding for this work. With funding platforms up the air, and Patreon recently flip flopping on their fee structure,
open source maintainers should have an easy to use option for receiving project funding.

It's also a good demo for what you can do with the recurring framework in Drupal Commerce.
